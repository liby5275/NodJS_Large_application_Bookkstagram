Bookstagram application

This is a web application for all the book lovers.

I myself is a person who loves to read books and collect them. So being a person who loves books and coding, I thought of creating an application which 
helps the user to catalouge their books, browse about other books, share their reviews on a book etc.

Technologies used are Node Js. This application is not yet complete as I have many more features in mind . But as of now below features are included

1. Automatic suggestion on 'next book to read' based on the previous likes of the user.
2. Search or browse any book in the world.
3. Review any book
4. Send or receive connection request from a fellow reader
5. Add books to your shelves like read, to-read, etc.


Features to be implemented next
